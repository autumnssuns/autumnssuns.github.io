## Guidelines: Seven Simple Steps to putting together your video

**Step 1**	**Decide on the best style** – Simple headshot style, at a desk, or a mix. What kind of text overlay, subtitles or graphics are required, if any? The latter may be required where you need to demonstrate some creativity in the position (e.g. UX designer role).

**Step 2**	**Draft up your script** – It should be short, well-structured and persuasive (90 seconds max). You need: a title page piece; an introduction; an elevator pitch; a core skills and competencies statement accompanied by at least one example (using the STAR technique); a little bit of personality showing; and a sign-off with contact details.

**Step 3**	**Set up the Scene Scape** – Arrange any props, background, or music as appropriate. Assemble graphics, text and sub-text requirements and map out the timing sequence. Ensure you are dressed and groomed professionally.

**Step 4**	**Rehearse** – Do several run-throughs and review the results. Maintain eye contact with the camera or use the interview angle looking 30% away from the camera (as if speaking to an interviewer) and review your body language to ensure it is open and positive without appearing too rehearsed.

**Step 5**	**Shoot your video** - Arrange for a quiet place to record where you will not be interrupted. Make sure it is well-lit. Ensure the camera you are using is easily operable, steady and focused correctly.

**Step 6**	**Edit your video** – Add a text title or subtitles to your opening scene frames. Insert pictures, example(s) of the of a current job advertisement you are addressing, charts and clips from other sources as appropriate. The rule here for this exercise is to keep it simple as possible using only easily accessible editing software.

**Step 7**	**Complete the Self Assessment Checklist and Submit your video** –  You will be submitting the video in 2 places. First, post to your Module 4 discussion forum to receive feedback from your ODG teammates. Second, upload your TMAY video to the submission link to receive feedback from your Mentor and one anonymous peer. Your video should only be in MP4 format.

Absolutely, let's take it step by step. 

### Step 1: Decide on the Best Style
First, let's decide on the style of your video. Here are a few options:
- **Simple Headshot Style**: Just you speaking directly to the camera.
- **At a Desk**: More casual, showing you in a work environment.
- **Mixed Style**: Incorporating text overlays, subtitles, or graphics.

**Question**: Which style do you think suits you best and why?

> I want to use a mixed style that is similar to an interview setup, and there will be a few different scenes, including outdoor far shot, office environment, as well as a desk view to keep the video engaging. I believe this style will help me showcase my creativity and authenticity effectively. I can provide more details on the scenes I'm thinking of if that would be helpful, or we can also come back to this later.

That sounds like a fantastic approach! A mixed style with different scenes will definitely make your video more engaging and dynamic. Let's move on to the next step.

### Step 2: Draft Your Script
Your script should be short, well-structured, and persuasive. Here's a suggested structure:
1. **Title Page**: Your name and the job role you're applying for.
2. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce yourself.
3. **Elevator Pitch**: Explain who you are, why you're perfect for the role, and what value you bring.
4. **Core Skills and Competencies**: Highlight key skills and provide an example using the STAR technique (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
5. **Personality**: Show a bit of your personality.
6. **Sign-Off**: Conclude with your contact details.

Mention how ADM+S is where the project of the job I'm applying for originated.
> - A segment where I talk about how my current experience aligns with the job I'm applying for. This will include me standing in front of QUT (Queensland University of Technology) to show my experience working in collaboration with different universities. This also works well since I am applying for a role at QUT.
> - A segment where I discuss my skills and competencies. This take place in the Computational Lab at QUT where I often visit for research and collaboration purposes, and will have me showcase my technical skills. This will start with me going towards my desk and showing my work setup, with a computer screen displaying some code snippets. This is where I use the STAR method to explain a project I worked on.
> - A concluding segment where I talk about my passion for technology and innovation, and how I believe I can contribute to the role, team, and company. This will use the main building of UQ as the backdrop to signify my passion for research. This will also include a brief mention of my contact details.

Your plan sounds well thought out and visually engaging! Let's move on to the next step.

### Step 3: Set Up the Scene Scape
Think about your background, lighting, and sound. Make sure everything looks professional and that you're dressed appropriately.

**Question**: Do you have a specific location in mind for recording your video? If so, do you need any tips on setting up the scene for each segment?

> I have a few locations in mind for each segment, as mentioned earlier. I will be recording the video in these locations to match the content of each segment. For the outdoor far shot, I will be using the UQ campus as the backdrop. For the office environment, I will be using the ADM+S office at UQ. For the desk view, I will be using the Computational Lab at QUT. I have access to these locations and can set up the scenes accordingly. I will ensure that the lighting and sound are appropriate for each location. If you have any specific tips on setting up the scene for each segment, I would appreciate your guidance.

Great, it sounds like you have a clear plan for your locations! Here are some tips for setting up each scene:

### Outdoor Far Shot (UQ Campus)
- **Lighting**: Natural light is best, but avoid direct sunlight to prevent harsh shadows. Early morning or late afternoon light is usually softer.
- **Sound**: Use a lapel microphone to ensure clear audio. Be mindful of background noise like wind or traffic.
- **Framing**: Position yourself slightly off-center to include the university logo in the background. Ensure the background is not too busy to keep the focus on you.

### Office Environment (ADM+S Office)
- **Lighting**: Use a combination of natural and artificial light. Position lights to avoid shadows on your face.
- **Sound**: Ensure the room is quiet. Use a microphone to capture clear audio.
- **Framing**: Include the office banner in the background. Keep the desk tidy and professional.

### Desk View (Computational Lab at QUT)
- **Lighting**: Use desk lamps or ring lights to illuminate your face evenly.
- **Sound**: Ensure minimal background noise. Use a microphone for clear audio.
- **Framing**: Show your work setup and computer screen with code snippets. Keep the background professional and uncluttered.

### General Tips
- **Dress**: Wear professional attire that suits the job role you're applying for.
- **Background**: Ensure the background is relevant and not distracting.
- **Props**: Use minimal props to keep the focus on you and your message.
- **Rehearse**: Practice your script in each location to ensure you’re comfortable and everything looks and sounds good.

### Step 4: Rehearse
Practice your script several times. Focus on maintaining eye contact with the camera and ensuring your body language is open and positive.

**Question**: How comfortable do you feel speaking on camera? Do you need any tips on body language or eye contact?

> I am relatively comfortable speaking on camera, but I want to ensure that my body language and eye contact are engaging and professional. I would appreciate any tips you have on maintaining eye contact with the camera and conveying confidence through body language. I will practice my script in each location to ensure I am comfortable and confident in my delivery.

That's great to hear! Here are some tips to help you maintain eye contact and convey confidence through your body language:

### Eye Contact
- **Look Directly at the Camera**: Imagine the camera lens is the person you're speaking to. This helps create a connection with your audience.
- **Avoid Shifting Your Gaze**: Try not to look around too much. Keep your focus on the camera to maintain engagement.
- **Practice**: It might feel unnatural at first, but with practice, it will become more comfortable.

### Body Language
- **Posture**: Stand or sit up straight with your shoulders back. Good posture conveys confidence and professionalism.
- **Gestures**: Use natural hand gestures to emphasize points, but avoid overdoing it. Keep your movements smooth and controlled.
- **Facial Expressions**: Smile and show enthusiasm. Your facial expressions should match the tone of what you're saying.
- **Movement**: If you're standing, feel free to move slightly, but avoid pacing. If you're sitting, keep your movements minimal but natural.

### Practice Tips
- **Record Yourself**: Practice in front of a camera and review the footage. This helps you see how you come across and make adjustments.
- **Feedback**: Ask friends or colleagues to watch your practice runs and provide feedback on your eye contact and body language.
- **Relax**: Take deep breaths before you start. Being relaxed will help you appear more confident and natural.

### Step 5: Shoot Your Video
Find a quiet, well-lit place to record. Make sure your camera is steady and focused.

**Question**: Do you have all the equipment you need for recording? If not, do you need any recommendations?

> I do not have professional recording equipment, unfortunately. All I have is my smartphone, which I plan to use for recording the video. I would appreciate any recommendations you have for ensuring the video quality is as good as possible using a smartphone. I will find a quiet, well-lit place to record and ensure the camera is steady and focused. I am open to any tips you have for recording with a smartphone to ensure the best video and audio quality.

Using a smartphone can still produce great results with the right techniques! Here are some tips to ensure the best video and audio quality:

### Video Quality
- **Resolution**: Set your smartphone to record in the highest resolution possible (usually 1080p or 4K).
- **Stability**: Use a tripod or a stable surface to keep your phone steady. If you don't have a tripod, you can improvise with books or other objects to keep your phone at the right height and angle.
- **Lighting**: Natural light is your best friend. Record near a window or use soft, diffused lighting. Avoid harsh overhead lights and backlighting.
- **Framing**: Position the camera at eye level. Make sure you are centered in the frame with some space above your head and your shoulders visible.

### Audio Quality
- **Microphone**: If possible, use an external microphone, like a lapel mic, that can connect to your smartphone. If you don't have one, ensure you are in a quiet environment to minimize background noise
