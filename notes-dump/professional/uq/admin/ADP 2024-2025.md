# Self Evaluation: 2024/25 Annual Performance and Development Process

## Copilot Conversation - Delivery Goals Formulation

I need help writing my self evaluation for the 2024/25 annual performance and development process. Help me by asking a series of short-answer questions to formulate my delivery goals, which is defined as:<br><br>'Delivery' encompasses the key responsibilities of your role as outlined in your position description.

Rather than setting a goal for each section of your position description, it is recommended that the goals set for 2025 are limited to actions, activities or priorities which will be a key focus for you over the next 12 months. These goals should be specific and distinct from the 'normal' tasks which you would undertake each year. An exception may be appropriate in circumstances where you are focussing on addressing/improving a distinct element within the 'normal' activities of your role.

It is advised that staff set a maximum of 5-7 goals in total across both Delivery and Citizenship & Leadership sections – quality is more important that quantity.

As part of the APD process and/or APD conversation, your manager may also identify specific goals for 2025.

Section tips

Each goal should only be tagged to one goal category - i.e., '2025 Professional/Executive - Delivery''. Selecting multiple goal categories will create issues for next years' APD process.

Delivery goals may include ambitious or 'stretch' goals.

Recognising that many roles have consistent delivery expectations year-to-year, there may be some circumstances where setting delivery goals is not necessary. Staff who don't set delivery goals will still be expected to reflect on their performance in next years' APD process.

New goals can be entered by clicking the ‘+ Add’ button.

Best practice for goal setting includes providing a summary in the ‘Goal’ box, listing key activities in the ‘Description’ box, and ensuring that a ‘Category’ and ‘Status’ are selected.

If you are unsure on what your Delivery goals for 2025 should be, remember that you can seek feedback/assistance from your manager.

Those are excellent areas to focus on for your development. Let's move on to the next question.

**Question 4:** Are there any processes or workflows within your role that you believe could be improved? How do you plan to address these improvements?

---

I believe the following processes or workflows could be improved:

- Automated Testing: There has been occasions where implementing new features or changes has led to unexpected bugs or regressions. I plan to address this by incorporating automated testing into the development process, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
- Documentation: At the moment, there is no standardised documentation process for projects. I plan to address this by creating a documentation template that includes key sections such as project overview, architecture, installation instructions, and troubleshooting. However, I understand this may be time-consuming so I may need to prioritise this based on project deadlines.
- Knowledge Sharing: It is often difficult to see what other developers are working on (especially if they are working on multiple projects). I plan to address this by ensuring my project progress is documented in a shared space (e.g., GitHub Projects) and encouraging others to do the same (if time permits).

---

These are valuable improvements that can significantly enhance your workflow and project outcomes. Let's proceed to the next question.

**Question 5:** How do you plan to improve your engagement with key stakeholders (e.g., clients, team members, other departments)? Are there specific strategies or activities you will implement?

---

I plan to improve my engagement with key stakeholders by:

- Regular Updates: Providing regular updates on project progress, milestones, and challenges to stakeholders through channels like email, project management tools, or face-to-face meetings.
- Feedback Sessions: Organising feedback sessions with stakeholders to gather input on project requirements, priorities, and expectations to ensure alignment with their needs.
- Collaboration: Actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with stakeholders on project planning, design, and implementation to foster a sense of ownership and shared responsibility.
- Training Sessions: Offering training sessions or workshops to stakeholders on new features, tools, or processes to enhance their understanding and adoption of the solutions developed.
- Communication Channels: Establishing clear communication channels and protocols for stakeholders to reach out with questions, feedback, or concerns to facilitate open and transparent communication.

---

These strategies will definitely help in building stronger relationships with your stakeholders. Let's move on to the next question.

**Question 6:** Are there opportunities for you to introduce new ideas or innovative approaches within your role? What specific actions will you take to foster innovation?

---

I see opportunities to introduce new ideas and innovative approaches within my role by:

- Experimentation: Encouraging a culture of experimentation and exploration to test new technologies, tools, or methodologies that could improve project outcomes or efficiency.
- Bite-sized Projects: Initiating small-scale projects or proof-of-concepts to test innovative ideas or solutions before scaling them up to larger projects.
- Cross-functional Collaboration: Collaborating with colleagues from different disciplines or departments to gain diverse perspectives and insights that could lead to innovative solutions.
- Continuous Learning: Investing time in continuous learning and professional development to stay updated on emerging trends, best practices, and technologies that could be applied to projects.
- Blogging: Sharing insights, experiences, and lessons learned through blog posts or articles to inspire others and spark discussions on innovative approaches and solutions.

---

These are excellent strategies to foster innovation within your role. Let's move on to the next question.

**Question 7:** What metrics or indicators will you use to measure your success in achieving your delivery goals? How will you track and report on your progress?

---

I plan to measure my success in achieving my delivery goals using the following metrics:

- Tests against Features: The percentage of features covered by automated tests to ensure comprehensive test coverage and early detection of bugs or regressions. This may be difficult to quantify but I aim to have at least 80% test coverage for critical features.
- Meeting Deadlines: The percentage of project milestones or deliverables completed on time to track progress and ensure timely delivery of outcomes. I aim to meet at least 90% of project deadlines (excluding external factors, e.g., dependencies on other teams).
- Quality of Documentation: The feedback on the quality and usefulness of project documentation from stakeholders or team members to assess the effectiveness of the documentation process. I aim to receive positive feedback on the clarity, completeness, and relevance of the documentation.
- Engagement with Stakeholders: The frequency and quality of interactions with stakeholders, including feedback received, collaboration opportunities identified, and training sessions conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of stakeholder engagement strategies. I aim to have regular (at least twice a month) interactions with stakeholders and positive feedback on the engagement process.
- Small Projects Completion: The number of small-scale projects or proof-of-concepts initiated and completed to test innovative ideas or solutions before scaling them up to larger projects. If the opportunity arises, I aim to complete at least four small projects in 2025 alongside my major projects.
- Number of Blog Posts: The number of blog posts published (no metrics on views or engagement) to track progress in sharing insights, experiences, and lessons learned with the wider community. I aim to publish at least one blog post per quarter (4 per year).

---

These metrics will provide a clear and structured way to measure your progress and success. Let's move on to the final question.

**Question 8**: What potential challenges do you anticipate in achieving your delivery goals? What strategies will you employ to overcome these challenges?

---

I anticipate the following challenges in achieving my delivery goals:

- Time Constraints: Balancing multiple projects and responsibilities may limit the time available to focus on skill development, process improvements, and innovation. To overcome this challenge, I plan to prioritise tasks based on project deadlines and allocate dedicated time for skill development and innovation.
- Technical Complexity: Implementing new technologies, tools, or methodologies may present technical challenges or require additional learning and experimentation. To address this challenge, I plan to invest time in continuous learning, seek guidance from colleagues or mentors, and break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
- Quality vs. Quantity: Striking a balance between delivering high-quality outcomes and meeting project deadlines or stakeholder expectations may pose a challenge. To mitigate this challenge, I plan to set clear priorities, communicate openly with stakeholders about trade-offs, and seek feedback early and often to ensure alignment with expectations.
- Stakeholder Engagement: Engaging with diverse stakeholders with varying needs, priorities, and communication preferences may require flexibility and adaptability. To address this challenge, I plan to tailor my communication and engagement strategies to the preferences of each stakeholder, actively seek feedback, and adjust my approach based on their input.
- Personal Development: Launching a personal blog and engaging in public speaking may require additional time and effort outside of regular work hours. To overcome this challenge, I plan to allocate dedicated time for blog writing and presentation preparation, set realistic goals and timelines, and seek support or feedback from colleagues or mentors.
