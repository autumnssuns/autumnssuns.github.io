What I know about Ashley Wright

Current role & domain

Ashley Wright is Senior Manager / Senior Systems Engineer (or variously titled “Senior Research Computing Systems Engineer / Senior Manager, Digital Research Infrastructure”) at UQ’s Research Computing Centre. Research Computing Centre+1

He is part of the Core Technologies / Digital Research Infrastructure group within RCC. Research Computing Centre+1

Expertise / Skills



Deep experience in HPC systems, large-data management, code optimisation. Research Computing Centre

Also experience with systems & service management and monitoring, networking, Linux programming. Research Computing Centre+1

Background & education



He holds degrees in both Information Technology (software engineering and networking) and Mathematics (computational, statistics, finance). Research Computing Centre+1

He previously worked at QUT (Queensland University of Technology) for more than 15 years before moving to RCC at UQ, helping with HPC and data analysis. Research Computing Centre+1

Current initiatives / projects



Involved with “Bunya”, which is UQ’s new supercomputer / HPC cluster, adopting an “evergreen and bespoke” approach: meaning incremental component additions, diverse system configurations, etc. eResearch Australasia+2Research Computing Centre+2

Participation in UQ’s research computing infrastructure, cloud platforms (eResearch cloud), data workflows, researcher support. Research+2Research Computing Centre+2

Values / attitudes



He seems to value technological change and seeing how researchers use computing and data to investigate and solve problems. Research Computing Centre

Interested in bridging hardware/software gaps, making research infrastructure work well for a wide variety of research disciplines. Research Computing Centre+1

What would likely resonate with him / what to keep in mind

Given that background, here are some points that your similarity to him (background in IT + Mathematics, moving from QUT to UQ) could connect with, plus some angles to emphasize:



Technical depth and interdisciplinary flexibility

He values people who are comfortable both with infrastructure (hardware, HPC, networks, system ops) and with mathematical / data-driven work (optimisation, computational stats, etc.).

So highlighting your experience in both those spheres will help: e.g. projects where you needed to optimize code or data pipelines, work with large data sets, any HPC or cloud experience, plus your math skills (statistical / computational modelling, algorithmic thinking, etc.).

Experience with HPC / scalable systems / workflows

Because RCC works with supercomputers, clusters, cloud infrastructure, workflows etc., any experience you have in dealing with large compute jobs, performance bottlenecks, containerization, managing jobs in cluster or cloud, etc., would align well.

Systems & operations mindset

Since he’s done systems/service management, monitoring, operations, etc., showing you understand operational concerns: reliability, monitoring, maintainability, performance, documentation, reproducible environments.

Appreciation for researcher/user perspective

From what I read, RCC supports researchers across disciplines. So someone who can understand what a researcher needs, can translate between the computational infrastructure and the science/discipline tasks, would likely be valuable.

Adaptability and continuous improvement

For example, with Bunya: the approach of building a cluster that can evolve over time, with incremental upgrades, mixed component configurations. That suggests he likes people who think in terms of modularity, maintainability, evolving systems rather than “build once and done”.

Collaboration & communication

Because RCC interacts with researchers in many fields, vendors/partners (as seen in vendor meetings, etc.), and participates in conferences. Being able to communicate both technically and in researcher-friendly terms is likely helpful.

Shared institutional knowledge

Your having moved from QUT to UQ gives you a shared background. If you can articulate what you learned at QUT that's applicable (for example, challenges in compute/data infrastructure, or services), that can help you show you understand the domain, the transition, and can bring value with both experiences.

How to gear your application / interview to appeal

Here are actionable things you might do / highlight:



In your cover letter or interview, mention your dual background (IT + Maths), and give concrete examples/projects where you applied both (say building a pipeline, optimizing code, handling statistical / computational tasks, or data modelling + infrastructure).

If you’ve done anything with HPC (job schedulers, clusters, parallel computing, code optimisation, performance profiling), show that.

If you have experience with cloud infrastructure, data storage, workflow tools (e.g. Slurm, Kubernetes, Docker, Nextflow, GitLab CI/CD, etc.), bring them up.

Emphasize what outcomes you achieved (faster run times, more stable systems, improved researcher experience, more scalable workflows) rather than only technical details.

Show interest in evolving systems and in thinking of infrastructure as living systems (maintenance, upgrades, monitoring, evolving hardware/software).

Demonstrate that you are user/researcher-oriented: that you can collaborate with non-computational people, understand their needs, translate technical constraints into solutions researchers can adopt.

Show awareness of the latest trends in HPC / research infrastructure: perhaps mention things like energy efficiency, cloud vs HPC trade-offs, heterogeneous hardware (GPUs, accelerators), data management challenges, reproducible research, etc. Since RCC and Ashley have been involved in conferences (ISC, etc.), showing you're up-to-date is good. Research Computing Centre+2Research Computing Centre+2

Use your QUT-to-UQ move as a strength: you know about both institutions (their challenges, culture, user expectations), which could help in transitioning or in helping coordinate or integrate services.

Cover Letter - Content

09 October 2025

Dear Mr Wright and the recruiting team,

Re: Full Stack Developer, reference number: R-56178

I am writing to express my interest in the Full Stack Developer position (Ref: R-56178) at the UQ Research Computing Centre. I possess a Bachelor of Computer Science and Computational Mathematics, and over four years experience as a full-stack web developer, working predominantly in the higher education sector at QUT and UQ. I have been a driving force behind building critical software applications that support both international and Australia-wide research projects. Interested in making a larger impact to UQ's research computing community, I see this role as the perfect next milestone in my career.

I currently work as a research software developer at the ARC Centre of Excellence in Automated-Decision Making (ADM+S), UQ Centre for Digital Cultures and Society (DCS), and the Australian Internet Observatory (AIO) where I have contributed to research infrastructure that support research in social, economic, environmental, ethical and legal issues. Through this role, I have gained extensive experience in full-stack web application design and development, utilising a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, development tools and architectures, including TypeScript, Python, Svelte 5, ReactJS, Electron, GitHub Actions, Docker and several AWS Services (EC2, S3, RDS, OpenSearch, Lambda, API Gateway). Additionally, I have been actively engaging in co-design processes, participating in data collection, facilitating workshops, data analysis, as well as contributing to the overall research project planning at a more strategic level in collaboration with multi-stakeholder interdisciplinary teams involving academics at different levels (Professors, Post-doctorates, PhD students) and universities as well as industry partners from the Foundation of Alcohol Research and Education (FARE), Economic Justice Australia, Services Australia, Google, etc. As a result, I possess a strong understanding in research infrastructure development and providing computational support in a fast-paced environment. I bring a proven ability to deliver user-focused, high-impact and scalable applications that bridges technical and research needs – skills that I believe align closely with the responsibilities of this role.

During my time at DCS, I was tasked with developing a portal for data collection, and additionally took the initiative to build a web-based data monitoring dashboard. During the second month of my role, the Australian Ad Observatory project needed to collect advertisement information on Facebook and Instagram Meta’s Data Download Packages. I researched, adopted and deployed a European full-stack software for data donation, where users can upload their DDPs requested from Meta. I rewrote the software, which used ReactJS and Python, to connect with an AWS Lambda function that stores data in an S3 bucket. Besides the data collection, I took part in data analysis by performing text classification with the FastText word embedding model, allowing researchers to quickly identify relevant keywords in the DDPs. Seeing the need for data monitoring during the study period, I prototyped a dashboard to display the keywords alongside ads collected from the Facebook and Instagram apps from Android devices via Australian Mobile Ad Toolkit developed by a colleague in the ADM+S. The dashboard was later used to support interviewing participants in the study, leading to a successful pilot study and a published research report. Since October 2024, my initiative has evolved into a full-stack Australian Ad Observatory Dashboard and is now serving over 130,000 advertisements collected from Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube across 600+ users. The dashboard empowers researchers from international institutions to sign in with SSO, create projects, monitor data collections, query ads and export data for analysis. This project includes a front-end in Svelte 5 with TypeScript, as well as a bespoke Python API framework deployed on AWS Lambda and API Gateway, integrated with AWS RDS (with PostgreSQL) and OpenSearch for fast, complex querying of substantial, unstructured advertisement data. In conjunction with a serverless architecture, optimisation techniques including virtualisation and caching were used to handle high-volume datasets effectively. The dashboard has also been inspiring the development of the AIO’s Lab Workspace that I am also a key contributor, which aims to provide a comprehensive set of tools for visualising and analysing rich digital social data. 

Additionally, my work with the ADM+S has ranged from developing static web applications, cross-platform desktop applications to web scraping with EC2-powered rotating proxies. Most notably, I was largely involved in co-designing a desktop document tool to support welfare rights lawyers in making sense of large Freedom of Information documents, comically referred to as “bricks” in the community. Through tight collaboration with a UI/UX designer, Economic Justice Australia’s representatives and researchers, I led the implementation of “Mortar”, which supports the loading and navigation of large volumes of PDF documents with thousands of pages, page tagging, highlighting, commenting and timeline-building. The use of ElectronJS allows me to leverage my knowledge in web development with ReactJS and TypeScript to create a cross-platform desktop application. This project also presented me with the opportunity to learn and practice my skills across all aspects of software development, including 1) collaborative design with Figma, 2) project management with GitHub Issues and Projects, 3) CI/CD with GitHub Actions, 4) software distribution with GitHub Releases and 5) documentation hosting with GitHub Pages. Given the sensitive nature of the legal documents as well as the resource constraints of community legal centres, I took careful consideration of the performance, security and ethical implications of the application. The application was well-received by the partner, who praised its ease of use and the significant time savings it provided in their document analysis workflow.

Besides the above major projects, I am also involved in smaller initiatives in ADM+S. One such initiative is the Trauma-Informed Algorithmic Assessment Toolkit (TIAKIT), which provides a reflective, constructive exercise to help algorithmic supported services be cognisant and inclusive of the diversity of human experience. This project has gained support from several partners, including Services Australia, Australia Red Cross, Lifeline, Anglicare and others. Built as a static web application using Svelte, this application uses browser’s IndexedDB API and the File System API to handle all data locally, addressing the privacy considerations of the participating organisations. Outside of supporting traditional research outputs, I have also been involved in a card-based co-design tool to support collaborative workshops for AI Policy Design. This tool was developed in collaboration with ADM+S researcher and an industry partner from Google, and has been extended into a plan for a full-stack software service to support more use cases and a wider audience.

My unique situation as a jointly funded employee between the ADM+S, DCS and AIO has positioned me to work with diverse teams of different sizes and dynamics, ranging from small, agile teams to larger, more structured groups. This experience has also required me to navigate multiple priorities with tight timelines, honing my ability to manage my workload effectively while maintaining high-quality standards. Outside of software development, I have also been involved in workshop facilitation, tools demonstration and feedback sessions. Combined with my previous experience as a Full Stack Web Developer, Research Assistant and Casual Academic at QUT, these experiences have strengthened my adaptability and communication skills, allowing me to comfortably work independently and collaboratively with diverse stakeholders across a wide range of research activities.

Committed to continuous learning and staying updated with emerging technologies, I am passionate about leveraging ever-evolving digital solutions to create meaningful impacts and drive innovation in the research community. I believe the Full Stack Developer role at the Research Computing Centre aligns perfectly with my career aspirations and values, and I am excited about the opportunity to make a larger impact in UQ's research community.

I greatly appreciate your time and effort in considering my application and I look forward to the opportunity to learn more about the Centre and discuss how my skills and experiences can contribute to its mission.

Yours sincerely,

Dan Tran
